ARM programs to illustrate tutorials

All files were forked from https://github.com/embedded2015/arm-lecture.
Some of them are example codes that we can follow 
the slide[ARM Introduction](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cFBRICktpVQAOLzE5eDKD-OM4ckJuncFsn39Wg8aLZI/edit#slide=id.p111
to practice them.

lab-1 and lab-1i are the first week homework . 
It's about complete the fibonacci function using two algorithms(recusive & iterative) written in ARM assembly language.
And I also optimized them.

lab-1/fib.s : complete teacher's  recursive sample code 

lab-1/fib_optimize/fib.s : using thumb2 conditional code to optimize the fib.s

lab-1i/fib.s : complete teacher's  non-recursive sample code 

lab-1i/fib_optimize1/fib.s : modify the loop code 

lab-1i/fib_optimize2/fib.s : modify the loop code

lab-1i/fib_optimize3/fib.s : modify the loop code 

lab-1i/fib_optimize4/fib.s : modify the loop code
